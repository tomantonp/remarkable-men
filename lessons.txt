I learned

.break {
    width: 100%;
    height: 0;
}

to get a new section.

I learned

    min-height: 350px;

Was useful as well in layout.

Other than that was happy using Flex to 
move things around.

The main difficulty was selecting images
and getting images to line up perfectly how I'd thought.

I used UL list with two tags to separate left and right header
and
    justify-content: flex-end;
with Right links

I used

    list-style: none;

to format the list

and

a {
    color: white;
    text-decoration: none;
}

to get the links looking nice.

I have of this moment forgotten how to publish the site on GitHub, but I need a break!
